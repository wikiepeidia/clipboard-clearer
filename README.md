# clipboard-clearer
batch file quickly fix your goofy clipboard
# REASON:
ON windows, for anyone who copy regulary, with some apps such as PHONE LINK thing, or copying 3d model thing ... there might be a chance that an app lock your clipboard so it cant be copied anything. therefore i use chat gpt to erase the need of typing cmd /c "echo.|clip" .
