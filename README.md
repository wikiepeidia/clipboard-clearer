# clipboard-clearer
This batch file quickly fixes issues with your clipboard.

# REASON:
On Windows, when copying regularly with certain apps such as PHONE LINK or 3D modeling software, there might be a chance that an app locks your clipboard, preventing anything from being copied. Therefore, I use a batch file to erase the need for typing "cmd /c "echo.|clip"."
